Handling Translations for Pondus
==================================

Creating a new translation:
-----------------------------

Run `msginit` in `po/` and follow the instructions.

Alternatively, you can also copy `pondus.pot` to `LL.po` (where LL is
your language code) and edit the header manually.

Translate the strings and send the resulting `LL.po` to
    mailto:pondus-dev@lists.berlios.de[]

Thanks!


Updating a translation:
-------------------------

Shortly before new releases, a notification will be sent to the mailing
list asking for an update of the translations.  Then, you can download the
`LL.po` file from the hg repository, translate new strings, correct changed
strings and send the resulting `LL.po` to
    mailto:pondus-dev@lists.berlios.de[]
