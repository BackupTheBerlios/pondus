pondus - personal weight manager for GTK+2


SYNOPSIS
--------
*pondus* [options]


OPTIONS

--version::
    show program's version number and exit

-h, --help::
    show a help message and exit

-i FILE, --input=FILE::
    read data from FILE instead of the standard location


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Pondus is a personal weight manager that keeps track of your body
weight. It aims to be simple to use, lightweight and fast. The data
can be plotted to get a quick overview of the history of your weight
and is stored in xml-files for easy access and modification with other
programs.

By default, the user data is stored in ~/.pondus/datasets.xml and is
written to this file automatically on exit, so you don't have to worry
about saving the data you entered.

All functionality is available via the toolbar or via keyboard/mouse
shortcuts. The following shortcuts are currently used:

CTR-a::                           add new dataset
CTR-d, Delete::                   delete selected dataset
CTR-e, Return, Double-click::     edit selected dataset
CTR-p::                           plot weight vs time

To improve the workflow, the add dialog is initialized with the current
date and the last measured weight. Both date and weight can be
incremented/decremented by one day/0.1kg by pressing ``+'' or ``-'',
respectively. Pressing ``Enter'' in one of the entry fields is a
shortcut for clicking the ``OK''-button.
