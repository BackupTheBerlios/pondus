---------------------------------------------

The easiest way to contribute to Pondus is to give feedback. Let us know
what you think about Pondus, suggest changes or improvements to the mailing
list <mailto:pondus-dev@lists.berlios.de[]> or report bugs at
http://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/issues/[]. We are looking forward to
your feedback.

Testing the Development Version
---------------------------------

If you want to use the latest development version of Pondus and help finding
new bugs or other problems, you can get the latest version from
http://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/[] or, if you have Mercurial installed,
type `hg clone http://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus`. This version can be
tested without installation by executing `pondus.py`.

Translating
-------------

You can help other people using Pondus by translating it from English to
another language. Instructions how to do so can be found in `po/README`.

Contributing Code
-------------------

If you want to implement a feature yourself, we will be happy to accept
patches sent to us via the mailing list. Alternatively, you can fork the
project at http://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/[] and ask me to pull the
changes.
