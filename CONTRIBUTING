Feedback, Comments, Suggestions, Bugreports
---------------------------------------------

The easiest way to contribute to Pondus is to give feedback. Let us know
what you think about Pondus, suggest changes or improvements to the mailing
list <mailto:pondus-dev@sharesource.org[]> or report bugs at
http://sharesource.org/project/pondus/bugs[] or
http://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/issues/[]. We are looking forward to
your feedback.

Testing the Development Version
---------------------------------

If you want to use the latest development version of Pondus and help finding
new bugs or other problems, you can get the latest version from
http://hg.sharesource.org/pondus[] or http://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/[]
or, if you have Mercurial installed, type
`hg clone http://hg.sharesource.org/pondus`. This version can be tested
without installation by executing `src/pondus.py`.

Translating
-------------

You can help other people using Pondus by translating it from English to
another language. Instructions how to do so can be found in `po/README`.

Contributing Code
-------------------

If you want to implement a feature yourself, we will be happy to accept
patches sent to us via the mailing list. In case you want to contribute code
regularly, you should get an account at http://sharesource.org[] and we will
be happy to give you write access to the crew repository located at
http://hg.sharesource.org/pondus-crew[]. Alternatively, you can also fork
the project at http://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/[] and ask me to pull
the changes.
