Pondus README
===============

Pondus is a personal weight manager that keeps track of your body
weight. It aims to be simple to use, lightweight and fast. The data
can be plotted to get a quick overview of the history of your weight.
A simple weight planner allows to define ``target weights'' and this
plan can be compared with the actual measurements in the plot.

For installation instructions read `INSTALL`.

Please report comments, suggestions and bugs to:

The current version can be found at:
    http://www.ephys.de/software/pondus/[]

Requirements:
---------------
 * python (>= 2.4)
 * pygtk (>= 2.6)

Recommended:
--------------
 * matplotlib to enable plotting functions

Usage:
--------
Pondus can be started from the command line with `pondus` or from the
menu of your desktop environment.

The following command line options are available:

    --version
        show program's version number and exit
    -h, --help
        show a help message and exit
    -i FILE, --input=FILE
        read data from FILE instead of the standard location

By default, the user data is stored in `~/.pondus/datasets.xml` and is
written to this file automatically on exit, so you don't have to worry
about saving the data you entered.

All functionality is available via the toolbar or via keyboard/mouse
shortcuts. The following shortcuts are currently used:

    CTR-a                           add new dataset
    CTR-d, Delete                   delete selected dataset
    CTR-e, Return, Double-click     edit selected dataset
    CTR-p                           plot weight vs time

To improve the workflow, the add dialog is initialized with the current
date and the last measured weight. Both date and weight can be
incremented/decremented by one day/0.1kg(lbs) by pressing `+` or `-`,
respectively. Pressing `Enter` in one of the entry fields is a shortcut
for clicking the `OK`-button.
