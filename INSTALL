Testing without installation
==============================

On every system where the requirements (python, pygtk, matplotlib) are
available, you can test pondus without installing it by executing
src/pondus.py.


Installation Instructions
===========================

Linux/Unix:
=============

For Debian and Ubuntu, .deb-packages are available at

    http://www.ephys.de/software/pondus/


On other systems, install Pondus by executing in the source directory
(as root):

    python setup.py install

The development package for python (python-devel or similar) and
gettext are needed for this, so please install them first.

Then, you can start Pondus (remember to switch back to the normal user)
with:

    pondus

or from the menu of your desktop environment.


Windows:
==========

A Windows installer can be found at

    http://www.ephys.de/software/pondus/

However, before using Pondus, you have to make sure that Python, GTK+,
PyGTK, NumPy and Matplotlib are installed. The installation directions
for (Py)GTK can be found at

    http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?req=show&file=faq21.001.htp

Then, Pondus can be installed by executing the provided installer.

The executable script to start Pondus should now be in

    C:\Python<version>\Scripts\pondus-win.py
